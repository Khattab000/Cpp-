/*
IMPORTANT the scope of #define goes even outside of functions e.g

#include <iostream>

void foo()
{
#define MY_NAME "Alex"
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n';

	return 0;
}

even tho its in the function and the funtion isnt called the #define is still valid bc the preprocessor doesn work with functions and just looks at the #include and #define but generally you want to avoid
that and write #define outside of functions

and #define also works if its in other files but you need to #include them first e.g
Alex.h:

#define MY_NAME "Alex"

main.cpp:

#include "Alex.h" // copies #define MY_NAME from Alex.h here  /*btw if its a sole function you can just use forward declaration instead but in this case we need to use #include to get the full library 
                                                                of the code its very useful to just use #inlcude if you are planning to use multiple functions of a file instead of doing a forward declaration
																for each funtction (if they are in the same file/
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n'; // preprocessor replaces MY_NAME with "Alex"

	return 0;
}

another example of the scope : 

function.cpp:
#include <iostream>

void doSomething()
{
#ifdef PRINT
	std::cout << "Printing!\n";
#endif
#ifndef PRINT
	std::cout << "Not printing!\n";
#endif
}


main.cpp:
void doSomething(); // forward declaration for function doSomething()

#define PRINT

int main()
{
	doSomething();

	return 0;
}
This will print "Not Printing!" bc even tho PRINT is defined in main it doesnt have any consequences on code of other file bc its only defined for main.cpp and not in the functions original file
