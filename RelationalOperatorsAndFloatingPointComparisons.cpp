	Even tho we expect it to output "d1 == d2" bc 0.01 == 0.01 it does not, it ouputs d1 > d2 instead, if you take a close look in the debugger you  can see that 
	d1 = 0.010000000000005116 and d2 = 0.0099999999999997868 both numbers are close to 0.01 but d1 is greater than and d2 is less than.
	As we discussed comparing floating point numbers can be dangerous bc floating point values are not precise and small reounding errors in the floating operand may cause it to be
	smalller or slightly larger than expected and this throws off the relational operators


	In some case using < or > on floating points is fine e.g if the two numbers are far apart thats where its reliable but if its very close to each other it becomes unreliable
	but in some cases its still fine as long as you get an answer like in a game where if its close to each other and it returns false instead of true it just looks like you barely 
	missed it so using relational operator <or > isnt recommended when reliabelity is important but it can be used in specific situations and can be useful

	Unlike < and > on floatin point values, == and != are much more problematic and should be avoided bc even the smallest rounding error can decide if its true or false making it much
	more likely to return false then true e.g
	*/
	std::cout << std::boolalpha << (0.3 == 0.2 + 0.1) << '\n'; // should print true but bc of rounding error it prints false / std::boolalpha is here so the bool that is returned from (0.3 == 0.2 + 0.1) is in words instead of 1 or 0
	// so generally avoid using  == or != to compare floating point value if there is any chance those values have been callculated 
	// in some cases its okey if its not calculated and compared to the same type and the literal also has the same type and it doesnt exceed the significand digits of the type e.g
#if 0
	if (someFcn() == 0.0) // of if someFcn() returns 0.0 as a literal only
	{ }

	constexpr double gravity{ 9.8 };
	if (gravity == 9.8) // okay if gravity is initialized with a literal value
#endif
	// Its mostly not safe to compare floating point literals with other diffrent type e.g 9.8f to 9.8 will reutrn false



	// There is a way tho to do floating point equality more reliable, for that some beginneres use a variable commonly called epsilon with the value of 0.00000001 or 1e-8 and the std::abs() function
	// In this case we just check if they are close enough std::abs(x - y) is used to the get the diffrence and make it positive and then its compared to <= Epsilon e.g approximatelyEqualAbs() function at the top
	// The main problem with the approximatelyEqualAbs() function is that comparing it to Epsilon might be good comparing inputs around 1.0 but is too big for inputs around 0.0000001 or very high numbers it would be too small so we need another way 


	constexpr double a{ 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 };  // should be close to 1.0 but it has rounding errors

	constexpr double relEps{ 1e-8 };  //0.00000001
	constexpr double absEps{ 1e-12 }; //0.000000000001 / recommended to be put to a very low number helps with calculations near zero

	std::cout << std::boolalpha; // prints true or false instead of 1 and 0

	//compare almost 1.0 to 1.0
	std::cout << approximatelyEqualRel(a, 1.0, relEps) << '\n';  // returns true
	//compare almost 0.0 to 0.0
	std::cout << approximatelyEqualRel(a - 1.0, 0.0, relEps) << '\n'; // returns false bc the math close to 0 broke down 

	// To circumvent the issue of the second call we can combine the first function that uses absEpsilon and the scond function that uses relEpsilon

	std::cout << approximatelyEqualAbsRel(a, 1.0, absEps, relEps) << '\n';  // returns true 
	std::cout << approximatelyEqualAbsRel(a - 1.0, 0.0, absEps, relEps) << '\n'; // returns true now with this function

	/* 
	In conclusion, comapring floating point numbers is a difficult topic and there is no "one size fits all" algorithm  that works for every case but the approximatelyEqualAbsRel()
	with relEps at 1e-8 and absEps at 1e-12 should be good enough to handle most cases you encounter

	Small Addition since C++23 we can make our functions approximatelyEqualAbsRel() and approximatelyEqualRel() be constexpr, the reason why it is only possible since C++23
	bc prior to that the std::abs function that is called in it became constexpr itself, so if you tried to call it prior to that after making you function constexpr it would fail
	bc constexpr function can only call other constexpr functions
