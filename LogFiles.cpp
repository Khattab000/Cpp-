/*
    IMPORTANT
   
to use a logger to create log files you first need to include the logger file to the project 
in this cas ist plog-master , AND also important is that you lower the warning level for that case 
for both the general warning level and the header warning level they are initially 4 for general and 3 for header
and also SUPER important add plog-master/include to the directorie in properties of the project

if done correctly the logfile.txt appears in the same place as your cpp files

/*
Just like we discussed in the lesson before there as a way to improve
debugging with prrint statements, by using #define PLACE_HOLDER
with that we can define whatever we want and put a #ifdef PLACE_HOLDER
and a #endif and put the debugging statement inbetween, with that we can
just deactivate all debugging statements when we comment out the 
#define PLACE_HOLDER

                      // you just comment out the #define to disable all of them
                      // in the case of a multiple files project we put the #define in a header file so we can put that in all files so we only need to comment it out once

/*
so that is a good improvement for the normal print debugging but it
still creates even more code clutter and in case of mispelling anything
or not including it in the header files its prune for errors so lets see 
an even better approach
*/

/*
The best approach for debugging is using a log. A log is  record
of event that happened and usually time-stamped. The process is called
logging. Typically Logs are written on a file which we call log files
so they can be reviewed later on and most applications and operating
systems write log files that can be used to diagnose issues that occur

Advantages of using log files :
1. Its seperated from the programs output 
2. Log files can easily be send to other people for diagnosis

You could use std::clog which is used for logging but it is just 
send to the error stream just like std::cerr , you could redirect it
tho to  a log file but its too much of a hassle so you better of 
using a third party tool and below we will use that
