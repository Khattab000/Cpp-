	// Key Insight: Operands, function argument and subexpression may be evaluated in any order so keep this in mind bc precedence and associativity doesnt affect that so keep that in mind when using function call using opernads evaluation order

	// small tasks add paranthesis to show the order of evaluation of the expression
	x = 3 + 4 + 5;
	x = ((3 + 4) + 5); // + has a higher prcedence than = so the  + expression is evaluated first and the + uses left to righ association so the 3 + 4 is first 

	x = y = z;
	x = (y = z);  // unlike +, = has right to left association so y = z is evaluated first

	z *= ++y + 5;
	z *= ((++y) + 5); // first is ++ bc it has the highest precedence, then + and then last *= with the lowest precedence

	a || b && c || d;
	(a || (b && c)) || d; // first is && bc it has the highest precedence then a || bc || uses left to right associativit and then ||d as last one
