/* important you can name the variables in a function x and y and also the variables in main x and y, but these two x and two y are entirely seperate and not the same and have the usual going
   into and out of scope and are initialzed and diffrent points of time and destroyed at diffrent point of times and dont affect each other bc they are NOT the same

/* In modern C++, the best practice is that local variables inside the function body should be defined as close to their first use as reasonable :
    
   
   std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int x{};       // x defined here
	std::cin >> x; // and used here

	std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
	int y{};       // y defined here
	std::cin >> y; // and used here

	int sum{ x + y }; // sum can be initialized with intended value
	std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n';
