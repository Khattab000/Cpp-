	std::cin >> answer; // bc the character can only take a single character it only takes the first character even tho the command promp lets you write more
	                    // if you write more it gets queued and if that happens the next std::cin wont wait for your input bc the additional inputs from your first input are still in the buffer

	char ch1{ 'a' }; // Initialized with the letter 'a' and is stored as integer 97
	char ch2{ 97 };  // Initialized with integer 97 the code of ('a') so ch1 and ch2 are the same but ch2 is not preferred / btw if you want to store a number you can also just use '' but it can only be one digit two digits would need a string 

	std::cout << ch1 <<" " << ch2 << ' ' << 'a' << '\n'; // Output : a a a

	                                           // but there are many more escape sequences (btw alwasy make sure its a \ not a /) which you can look up on the table but notable ones are : \'  prints a single quote, \" prints a double quote, \\ prints a backslash
	// some examples of escape sequences 

	std::cout << "\"This is quoted Text\"\n";
	std::cout << "This string conatains a single backslash \\\n";
	std::cout << "6F in hex is char '\x6F'\n"; // \x(number) translates into char represented by hex number


	// single quote char and escape sequences (unless they are imbedded in the string) and double quote strings / but for output you can use double quote on char too for consistency sake#
	// avoid multicharacter literals even when they are possible e.g '56' bc they are not part of the C++ standart and may cause íssues 
	//One last thing diffrent character types exist e.g char32_t but arent recommended or useful for the current time doing the tutorial its mostly used unless you plan to make your  code Unicode compatible
