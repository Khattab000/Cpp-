/* Question #1

a) Why are named constants often a better choice than literal constants?

b) Why are const/constexpr variables usually a better choice than #defined symbolic constants?

Answer : a)Using literal constants (magic numbers) in your program makes your program harder to understand and to modify, named constants make these process much easier.
         b) They are a better choice bc #define dont show up on the debugger and may cause naming confliction more often

/*  Question #5

Write a program that asks for the name and age of two people, then prints which person is older.

Here is the sample output from one run of the program:
