	// Conclusion: Prefer constant over object-like macros (#define) with substitution text / bc its prone to errors ,harder to debug and it behaves diffrently
	// If you want to use an constant variable for multiple files you can and you should store them all in a central place  we will learn about that later on ( 7.9 -- Sharing global constants across multiple files)
	// const is a type qualifier / C++ has two type qualifiers const and volatile / volatile is rarely used and basically tells the compiler that the object may have its value changed at any time, that might help for certain kinds of optimization
