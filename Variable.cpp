/* there are many diffrent ways to initialize
int a;  no initializer 
int b = 5; initial value after equals sign (copy initialization)
int c(6);  initial value in parenthesis (direct initialization)
int d {7}; initial value in braces (direct list initialization) also the preferred one for example some of the other initializations would just convert a fraction like 4,5 to 4 but this one just gives an error
int e = {8}; initial value in braces after equals sign (copy list initialization)
int f {}; initializer is empty braces (value initialization) that one preferred too over the no initializer
