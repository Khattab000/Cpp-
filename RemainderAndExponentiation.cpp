	//We make exponents using std::pow() dont forget to #include <cmath> e.g

	double p{ std::pow(3.0,4.5) }; // 3^4.5   / unlike remainder, exponent uses float only so if you want to use integer or get an integer result make your own algorithm 
	std::cout << p << '\n';

	// unlike remainder, exponent uses float only so if you want to use integer or get an integer result make your own algorithm e.g powint() /its a self written function
	std::cout << powint(-7, 13) << '\n';  // now we can use int instead of float /keep in mind no negative exponents for this function
	// but in a lot of cases exponentiation will overflow for integral types thats why its preffered to use std::pow() with the double type and thats also a reason why std::pow is included in the standard library
