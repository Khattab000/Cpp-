/* 
   We use bit manipulation for optimization e.g an object needs to be at least 1 byte but if its a boolean it only needs one bit but it still uses 8 bits (1 bit for true or false and the
   rest are unused) and with bit manipulation we can group multiple boolean in one byte so it only uses 1 bit and each bit of thoes booleans are called bitflags

	// We number bits from right to left and the first position starts at 0 (we are just talking about the position so the first bit can be 0 or 1)

	/*
	In an earlier lesson we showed that we can use std::bitset to pring values in binary but it has some other functions too that are essential for bit manipulation e.g
	- test() // tells us if a bit is 0 or 1 
	- set() // turn a bit on but if the bit is alread turned on it does nothing, turn on means 1
	- reset() // turn off a bit but if the bit is already turned off , turn off means 0
	- flip() // flips a bit value from 0 to 1 or vice versa

	Giving our bits names can help making the code more readable / we more so give the bit positions the names / dont worry about this using more space bc of all the int variables
	are optimized out in compile time bc they are constexpr type so using std::bitset still will save some space bundeling the boolean values

	/*
	  One very important thing is the size of std::bitset which is the bytes needed to hold the bits rounded to the nearest sizeof(size_t) which is 4 Bytes on 32-bit machines and 
	  8 Bytes on 64-bit machines thus a std::bitset<8> will usually use either 4 or 8 Bytes, which might be surprising but the reason for that is that std::bitset isnt made to for memory
	  savings but for speed optimization even tho it only needs 1 Byte to store 8 Bits. Thus we use std::bitset<> when we desire convenience and speed not memory saving

	  For Memory saving we use unsigned integer flags which we cover in a later lesson
