	                             // Const variables that are not compile time constants are called runtime constants (can not be used in a constant expression) e.g Const non-integral variables are always runtime constants even with a constant expression initializer (if you need it to be compile time constant define them as constexpr instead)

	std::cout << 3 + 4 << '\n'; //is a runtime expression but with a constant sub expression (3 + 4) in this case only the 3 + 4 is getting optimized and runs in compile time the rest  is ran in runtime / we call that constant folding

	   Ranking variables and their likelyhood to be optimized:
	   1. compile time constant variables (always eligble)
	   2. runtime constant variable
	   3. non const variable (likely only in simple cases)

	// Conclusion: Constant expressions (including constexpr variables and constexpr functions) can help produce code that is faster, smaller, and safer. Some C++ features require constant expressions.
	// One big disadvantage of the optimization is it makes it harder to debug in runtime e.g when a variable or a function is optimized out/away the debugger might behave strangely or skip over those when trying to watch them or step into them and we dont have many tools to debug in compile time thats why most of the time debug builds turn off optimizations so the compiled code will more closely match the source code
