/*
  A debugger is a computer program that allows the programmer to 
  control how another program executes and examine the prgram state
  while that program is running, a debugger can be used to examine 
  a program line by line for example to check the variable and how
  it changes throughout
*/
// first we try out stepping where we go through the code step by step
// step into : The step into command executes the next statement in the normal execution path of the program, and then pauses execution of the program so we can examine the programâ€™s state using the debugger. If the statement being executed contains a function call, step into causes the program to jump to the top of the function being called, where it will pause.
// step out : basically helps you get out of a funtction by executing the rest of the function if afer you stepped into it and also executes the next step
// step over: skips the function by executing the funtion fully and then proceeds instead of stepping in and going line by line , you use it if your not interested in a function, there is no function or if its part of the standard library
