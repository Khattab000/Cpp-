	// suffixes are not case sensitive but s and sv must be lower case and to consecutive l or L must have the same casing /But prefer literal suffic L (upper cae ) over l(lower case)

	// unlike most literals (which are are values) , C-style string literals are const objects which are created at the beginning of the program and stay for the entirety of the program

	// so do this instead e.g :
	const int maxStudentsPerClass{ 30 };
	const int totalStudents{ num Classrooms * maxStudentPerClass }; // now obvious what this 30 means

	const int maxNameLenght{ 30 };
	set{ maxNameLenght }; // now obvious this 30 is used in a diffrent context

	// but literals used in obvious context that are unlikely to change arent considere magic mostly used -1, 0, 0.0, 1 e.g:

	int idGenerator{ 0 }; // fine: we're starting our id generator with value 0
	idGenerator += 1;     // fine: we're just incrementing our generator

	int kmtoM(int km) {
		return km * 1000; // fine its obvious 1000 is a conversion factor
	}

	// Conclusion: try to avoid magic numbers in your code (use constexpr instead see lesson 5.5)
