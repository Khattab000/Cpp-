Write the following program: The user is asked to enter 2 floating point numbers (use doubles). The user is then asked to enter one of the following mathematical symbols: +, -, *, or /.
The program computes the answer on the two numbers the user entered and prints the results. If the user enters an invalid symbol, the program should print nothing.

Question 3

Extra credit : This one is a little more challenging.

Write a short program to simulate a ball being dropped off of a tower.To start, the user should be asked for the height of the tower in meters.Assume normal gravity(9.8 m/s^2),
and that the ball has no initial velocity(the ball is not moving to start).Have the program output the height of the ball above the ground after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 seconds.
The ball should not go underneath the ground(height 0).
Use a function to calculate the height of the ball after x seconds.The function can calculate how far the ball has fallen after x seconds using the following formula :
distance fallen = gravity_constant * x_seconds^2 / 2
*/

	}
}

	printUpdate(1, distance_fallen(1, height));
	printUpdate(2, distance_fallen(2, height));
	printUpdate(3, distance_fallen(3, height));
	printUpdate(4, distance_fallen(4, height));
