// Object sizes and sizeof operator

/*
An object with n bits(where n is an integer) can hold 2 ^ n e.g 8Bit Byte can hold 2 ^ 8 (256) diffrent Values and an object that uses 2Bytes can hold 2 ^ 16 (65536) diffrent Values

In order to determine the size of a type on a particualar machine we use the the sizeof operator, it takes a variable or type and returns it size in bytes

For Advanced Lessons: sizeof doesnt include dynamically allocated memory used by an object
